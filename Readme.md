STOCK PREDICTION MODEL


Title: Comparison of LSTM and ARIMA Models for Stock Prediction
Description: This project compares the performance of LSTM and ARIMA models for predicting stock prices of five tech companies, namely Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta. The project is aimed at identifying the strengths and limitations of each model, and determining which model provides more accurate predictions. The data used for the project is collected from Yahoo Finance, and the LSTM and ARIMA models are trained and evaluated using Python and Keras libraries. The project findings can be useful for investors and traders who are interested in predicting stock prices and making informed decisions.
